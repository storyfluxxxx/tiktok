  <h1>StoryFluxxxx – Short Video Automation Tool</h1>

  <p>
    StoryFluxxxx is a desktop tool that helps creators automate the production of
    short-form story videos. It combines AI-generated stories, text-to-speech
    voiceover, subtitles, and pre-recorded background gameplay into vertical
    videos optimized for platforms like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram
    Reels.
  </p>

  <p>
    The application runs locally on the user’s computer. It does not provide a
    public web service and does not collect personal information on external
    servers. When connected to TikTok via the official API, the user explicitly
    grants permission to publish videos to their own account.
  </p>

  <p>
    All content, upload actions, and account permissions are fully controlled by
    the user. StoryFluxxxx simply automates repetitive steps in the content
    creation workflow.

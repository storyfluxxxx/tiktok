  <h1>Privacy Policy for StoryFluxxxx</h1>

  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-12-02</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    StoryFluxxxx is a desktop application that helps users generate and upload
    short-form story videos. The tool is designed to run locally on the user’s
    own device and does not operate as an online service.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Processing</h2>
  <p>
    The application processes the following types of data locally on the
    user’s device:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>AI-generated story text and subtitles</li>
    <li>Audio files created from text-to-speech</li>
    <li>Video files (background gameplay and rendered clips)</li>
    <li>API tokens or credentials necessary to upload content to the user’s
        own social media accounts (for example TikTok or YouTube)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This data is stored only on the user’s device in the project folders
    configured by the user. StoryFluxxxx does not upload or sync this data to
    any external server operated by the developer of this tool.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    When the user chooses to connect their TikTok or YouTube account, the
    application may communicate directly with the official APIs of these
    platforms in order to upload videos or manage content. In this case, the
    processing of data is governed by the respective platform’s own privacy
    policy and terms of service.
  </p>

  <p>
    Any access tokens or credentials obtained via these APIs are stored locally
    on the user’s device and are only used by the application to perform the
    actions explicitly requested by the user.
  </p>

  <h2>4. No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
  <p>
    StoryFluxxxx does not include any built-in analytics, tracking pixels,
    advertising SDKs, or other mechanisms to monitor user behaviour. The
    developer of StoryFluxxxx does not receive telemetry or usage statistics
    from the application.
  </p>

  <h2>5. User Responsibility</h2>
  <p>
    Users are responsible for ensuring that the content they generate and upload
    complies with the terms, community guidelines, and privacy rules of TikTok,
    YouTube, and any other platforms they use.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact the
    developer of StoryFluxxxx via the contact information provided in the
    relevant app store, repository, or distribution channel.
